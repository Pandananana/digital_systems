WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl has an input control pin RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/PR_Address_In_sig[7]) which is driven by a register (DataPathComp/RegFile/U2/R5_gen[7].UR5_gen/Q_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
