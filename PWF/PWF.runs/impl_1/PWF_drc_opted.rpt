<<<<<<< HEAD
The RAMB18E1 RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl has an input control pin RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ADDRARDADDR[6]) which is driven by a register (MPC/InstReg/IR_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB18E1 RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl has an input control pin RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (MPC/InstReg/IR_reg[13]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
