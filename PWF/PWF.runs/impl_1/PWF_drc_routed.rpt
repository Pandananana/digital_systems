Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net MPC/InstDecCont/FS_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MPC/InstDecCont/FS_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell MPC/InstDecCont/FS_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl has an input control pin RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ramb_bl.ramb18_sin_bl.ram18_bl/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: RAM/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/PR_Address_In_sig[6]) which is driven by a register (DataPathComp/RegFile/U2/R13_gen[6].UR13_gen/Q_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
